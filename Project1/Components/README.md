# Title for selection:

### The group members: Gabriella Stickney, Bhaaniu Jain

###### The format of your score files:

###### The actual score file used for your selection: 

effects_test.score is the score file used to demonstrate the effects component. AI was used to add some chords towards the end to create a longer piece.

wave.score is the file used to demonstrate the @@@@ synthesizer component.

furelise.score is the score file used to demonstrate all of the components together.

**Remove!! One page for each component that describes the functioning of that component in detail.  Indicate ownership of each component and what grading elements are supported.

The synthesis component(s) was completed by Gabriella.

Synthesis Component(s):
- Additive:
The additive component is a technique that creates sound by combining sine waves. An additive synthesizer uses the principle that any sound can be formed by adding sinusoid, by specifying the amplitudes of the fundamental frequency and its harmonics.

The grading elements supported are 
- Sinusoid playback on demand from the sequencer
- Definition of all harmonics
- Envelope generation
- Polyphony
- Sound cross-fading
- Vibrato




The effects were completed by Bhaaniu.

Effects:

- Noisegate:
  Noise gates are common in audio recording and live sound environments. They help keep audio clean by preventing background sounds from entering the mix. Theyâ€™re often used on individual instrument tracks, vocal recordings, and drum microphones to prevent bleed from other instruments or ambient noise.
- Compression:
  Compression is a dynamic audio processing technique that reduces the volume of the loudest parts of a sound while boosting softer parts, resulting in a more balanced and controlled sound.
- Chorus:
  Chorus is an audio effect that thickens and broadens a sound by creating multiple, slightly varied copies of the original signal and blending them. This simulates the effect of multiple instruments or voices playing or singing the same notes together.
- Flange:
  Flanging is an audio effect that creates a sweeping, jet-like sound by mixing two identical audio signals, with one signal slightly delayed. This slight delay causes phase cancellations and reinforcements in different frequency bands, producing a characteristic "whooshing" or "swirling" effect.
