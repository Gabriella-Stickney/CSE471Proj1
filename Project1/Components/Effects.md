Effects:

- Noisegate:
  Noise gates are common in audio recording and live sound environments. They help keep audio clean by preventing background sounds from entering the mix. Theyâ€™re often used on individual instrument tracks, vocal recordings, and drum microphones to prevent bleed from other instruments or ambient noise.
- Compression:
  Compression is a dynamic audio processing technique that reduces the volume of the loudest parts of a sound while boosting softer parts, resulting in a more balanced and controlled sound.
- Chorus:
  Chorus is an audio effect that thickens and broadens a sound by creating multiple, slightly varied copies of the original signal and blending them. This simulates the effect of multiple instruments or voices playing or singing the same notes together.
- Flange:
  Flanging is an audio effect that creates a sweeping, jet-like sound by mixing two identical audio signals, with one signal slightly delayed. This slight delay causes phase cancellations and reinforcements in different frequency bands, producing a characteristic "whooshing" or "swirling" effect.
